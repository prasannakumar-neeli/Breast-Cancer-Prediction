Breast Cancer Prediction

Objective:
The goal of this project is to classify breast tumors as Benign or Malignant using machine learning techniques. This helps assist early diagnosis and supports medical professionals in making informed decisions.

Problem Statement:
Breast cancer diagnosis requires analyzing several cellular features extracted from biopsy samples. Manually interpreting these measurements is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on input features.

Dataset:
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset (UCI Repository)

Tech Stack:

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn (Decision Tree Classifier)
Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

Key Outcomes:

A trained Decision Tree model that predicts tumor type
Visualization of the decision tree for interpretation (tree.png)
High accuracy on both training and testing data
A complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data loading to model evaluation
